# Web UI

You can google to search how to generate a django project\
[here](https://ithelp.ithome.com.tw/users/20111829/ironman/1804) is my reference, which I also learned from.

# Code
This is demo version\
[buffetProject_240516](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Pwr4eKatyo4bFE26JR071w2OA1Du7APz?usp=drive_link)

This is final version (it delete redundant code from buffetProject240516, it will not affect the results of the display)\
[buffetProject_241201](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1F4wTsTuuHcQjv1ANcS9yVGLJcu8D9VdE?usp=drive_link)
